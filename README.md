# ComfyUI-fal-Connector

The ComfyUI-fal-Connector is a tool designed to provide an integration between
`ComfyUI` and `fal`. This extension allows users to execute their ComfyUI
workflows directly on `fal.ai`. This enables users to leverage the
computational power and resources provided by `fal.ai` for running their
ComfyUI workflows.

## Usage

### Installation:

1. **Cloning the required repositories:** Clone the [ComfyUI-fal](https://github.com/badayvedat/ComfyUI-fal.git) and install the required dependencies using the
   provided requirements.txt file. `ComfyUI-fal` repository includes all the necessary custom extensions including this one.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/badayvedat/ComfyUI-fal.git

cd ComfyUI-fal

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set up credentials:**

   - Generate a `fal` API key from [fal dashboard](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys)
   - (Optional) Get your Hugging Face token from [Hugging Face settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
   - Add these credentials to the `fal-config.ini` file in the `ComfyUI-fal/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-fal-Connector` directory:

   ```ini
   [fal]
   application_name = fal-ai/comfy-server/stream
   api_key = your-fal-api-key

   [huggingface]
   token = your-huggingface-token  # Optional
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> The `fal-config.ini` file is not in the root directory of the `ComfyUI-fal`
> repository, but in the `ComfyUI-fal/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-fal-Connector` directory.

4. **Start the Comfy Server:** Run the `main.py` file to start the Comfy server and
   initiate the connector.

5. **Execute Workflows:** Use ComfyUI to create and configure your AI workflows.
   When ready, execute the workflows directly on `fal` using the connector.

## How to use it outside of ComfyUI?

After you set up a workflow, and made sure it is working properly. You can generate a
"fal format" using `Save as fal format` button. Then you can post the generated JSON
to `https://fal.run/fal-ai/comfy-server` to execute it and obtain the results.
